normalization:
move builtins and operators in their own folder ?

type-inference:
something that involves destructuring a recordtype after merge
add some of the more complicated Prelude tests back, like List/enumerate
failure/
    merge { x = λ(x : Bool) → x } (< x: Bool | y: Natural >.x True)
    merge { x = λ(_ : Bool) → _, y = 1 } < x = True | y >
    merge { x = True, y = 1 } < x | y >.x
    merge {x=...,y=...} <x>.x
    merge {x=...,y=...} <x:T>.x
