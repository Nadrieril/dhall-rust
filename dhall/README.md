# `dhall`

Implementation of the Dhall configuration language.

WARNING: This is an internal crate used for [`serde_dhall`], you probably want
to use that instead.

WARNING: The API is very unstable and does not respect semver; use at your own risk. If you want to
use this crate directly anyways, have a look at [these tests].
